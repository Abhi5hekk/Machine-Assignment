## Problem Statement
Given, IRIS Dataset (from UCI ML Repository) containing 4 real-valued attributes
describing various features of a plant and a label describing the class of iris plant(i.e Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, Iris Virginica).
* Train a 3-layered Multi-layered Perceptron model with multiple sets of hyper-parameters
(learning rate, number of hidden nodes) 20 times.
* Get cross validation scores (k-fold or any other) for all training regimes of different sets
of hyperparameters.
* Make boxplots of the results obtained for different sets of hyperparameters and pick the
best among them using some heuristic.
* Train the model on the complete training dataset using the best set of hyperparameters
and obtain the results of the model on the test dataset.
* Plot Cumulative Match Characteristic (CMC) curve for showing improvement in test
accuracy of the final model with increment in the Rank values.
